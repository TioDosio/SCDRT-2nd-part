The objective of this project is to design a networked real-time
controller for a distributed illumination system on a small-scale
model of an office space. Conceptually, each desk is served by a
smart luminaire installed in the ceiling immediately on top of it.
The luminaire has a light emitting source to illuminate the desk, a
luminance sensor to measure the light reflected from the desk, a
presence sensor to determine if the desk is occupied or free, and
computational and communication elements to perform the
control of the system. In the project, we will simulate the office
with a small opaque cardboard box. Each luminaire consists of a
breadboard with a microcontroller that drives a light-emitting
diode (LED) and measures illuminance with a light-dependent
resistor. All luminaires will be connected to a control network via
the CAN-BUS for message exchange. The objective of the project
is to control the dimming level of each LED in a coordinated way
to maximise the comfort of users while minimising the energy
consumption.
